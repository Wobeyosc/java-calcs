# Simple Javascript Calulator

## A small calulator for common funnel conversions I do

e.g. 1000 people visit a page * 0.2 conversion rate =~ 200 people purchasing a product. 

### Current Limitations & Next Steps
--- 

* Only accepts whole numbers for conversion rate and not decimal (e.g 3.5%)
* Does not let you put in price of product you are selling to calculate total profit
* Form is basic hmtl without any formatting
* Does not display result under form fields / on page only in console.
