# Simple Javascript Calulator :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## A small calulator for common funnel conversions I do

e.g. 1000 people visit a page * 0.2 conversion rate =~ 200 people purchasing a product. 

**Version 1**

### Current Limitations & Next Steps
--- 

* ~~Only accepts whole numbers for conversion rate and not decimal (e.g 3.5%)~~
(Now accepts up to 1 decimal place)
* Does not let you put in price of product you are selling to calculate total profit
* ~~Form is basic html without any formatting~~
* ~~Does not display result under form fields / on page only in console.~~
* ~~Page is not hosted so page has to be run locally~~
* Be able to calculate between number of visitors per day, week, month and year easily.
* Not responsive

### Extra features
---
* Set up a mutli stage funnel (e.g. 10% of 10% = 0.01% if you have dropoff)
* Pull in approximate conversion rates or help you calculate yours
* Convert currency based on todays prices for estimated profit.
* Estimate based on profit number how many visitors are needed over a time period.
